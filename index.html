      <p>Once upon a time in a deep russian forest... That's too cliche? Ok, 26 years ago Indira Dzhanibekova was born in Latvia (part of USSR at that moment). Since that day she changed a lot. Let's not remember everything that happened with her since she was born, but we can highlight a few moments that will explain why this article was written. 3 years ago she came to the USA and started everything from the blank page. She tried to understand what she wants to do in her new country where everything can become true. Coding! That's what can be very interesting and help to make good money for her and her little son. So here we are! This article correctly centered on the page according the other HTML elements is the first step for the great "American dream".</p>
